## Project Highlights

### Project 1: Student Score Prediction

- **Objective:** Predict students' exam scores based on study habits and other factors.
- **Dataset:** [Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data cleaning and handling missing values.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): visualizations of study time, attendance, and exam scores.
  - Feature selection and engineering.
  - Train-test data split.
  - Built a regression pipeline (StandardScaler + LinearRegression).
  - Evaluated model performance (MSE, RÂ², MAE) and visualized results.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, visualization, regression modeling, performance evaluation.

### Project 2: Sales Forecasting

- **Objective:** Forecast future sales based on historical Walmart sales data.
- **Dataset:** [Walmart Sales Forecast (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast)
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data loading and aggregation to weekly sales.
  - Feature engineering: time-based features (year, month, week), lag values, rolling means, cyclical encodings.
  - Time series train-test split.
  - Model training: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
  - Evaluated and visualized actual vs. predicted sales.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Time series forecasting, feature engineering, regression, model comparison.

### Project 3: Melbourne Housing Price Prediction

- **Objective:** Predict house prices in Melbourne using machine learning regression techniques.
- **Dataset:** Melbourne housing data (features include suburb, address, rooms, type, price, location, and property characteristics).
- **Key Steps:**
  - Loaded and explored the dataset to understand available features and distributions.
  - Selected relevant features such as number of rooms, bathroom count, land size, latitude, and longitude.
  - Built a Decision Tree Regressor model using scikit-learn to predict property prices.
  - Trained the model and made predictions on sample properties.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data exploration, feature selection, regression modeling, prediction, and Python with scikit-learn.

### Project 4: Traffic Sign Recognition

- **Objective:** Classify German traffic signs from images using deep learning.
- **Dataset:** [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-signs)
- **Key Steps:**
  - Downloaded and preprocessed image data (resize, normalize, one-hot encode labels).
  - Performed data augmentation to improve model generalization.
  - Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras with multiple convolutional, pooling, dense, and dropout layers.
  - Trained and evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
  - Visualized training history and performance.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Deep learning, computer vision, CNNs, image preprocessing, TensorFlow/Keras.
